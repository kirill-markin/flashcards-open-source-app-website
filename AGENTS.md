# flashcards-open-source-app-website

Marketing website for Flashcards Open Source App. Static Next.js site deployed on Vercel.

**Git Workflow**: commit directly to `main`; deploy is automatic after push.

## Rules

- Use English for code comments and documentation.
- Prefer functional programming and pure functions.
- Use classes only for connectors to external systems.
- Use strict typing across functions, variables, and collections.
- Avoid fallback logic unless explicitly requested.
- Raise explicit, actionable errors with context.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the current request.
- Prefer non-interactive terminal commands.
- RTL support: use CSS logical properties such as `inset-inline-start`/`end`, `margin-inline-start`/`end`, `padding-inline-start`/`end`, and `text-align: start`/`end`; do not use physical directional properties.

## Development

- `npm run dev`: development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build`: production build
- `npm run lint`: ESLint

## Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript, React 19 Server Components
- Tailwind CSS v4 + CSS Modules
- Markdown via `gray-matter` and `remark`
- Path alias: `@/*` -> `./src/*`

## Core Principles

- Static generation first: pre-render all content at build time; no request-time server computation.
- Server Components first: use client components only where interactivity is required (`AuthButton`, header mobile menu).
- Public content only: no secret pages, private data, or server-side personalization.
- No request-time HTML rendering: do not add SSR, server-side cookie checks, or similar HTML personalization; if a UI detail depends on browser state, handle it after load in a small client component.
- Narrow runtime negotiation layer: keep the proxy only for `.md` URLs, `Accept: text/markdown`, `Vary: Accept`, `Link rel="alternate"`, and existing host-level redirects; never use it for HTML rendering or personalization.
- Static Markdown and LLM assets: `.md` URLs and `Accept: text/markdown` are required public interfaces; generate Markdown and `llms.txt` at build time whenever possible and use the runtime proxy only to route to those prebuilt assets.
- Shrink client islands over time instead of adding SSR; prefer server-rendered shells with small client islands for auth buttons and mobile navigation.

## Project Structure

- `src/app/`: landing, features, pricing, docs, blog, privacy, terms
- `src/components/`: shared components (`Header`, `Footer`, `AuthButton`)
- `src/content/pages/`: typed marketing page content modules plus markdown-backed legal pages
- `src/content/docs/`: documentation markdown files
- `src/content/blog/`: blog markdown files
- `src/lib/`: utilities (`auth` helpers)

## Auth Integration

The site has zero auth logic. It only checks whether the `logged_in` cookie is present (set by `auth.flashcards-open-source-app.com` on `.flashcards-open-source-app.com`) to switch between "Log In / Sign Up" and "Open App" buttons. There is no JWT verification.

## Domain Layout

| Domain | What | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flashcards-open-source-app.com` | This marketing site | Vercel |
| `app.flashcards-open-source-app.com` | Main app | AWS CloudFront + S3 |
| `auth.flashcards-open-source-app.com` | Cognito auth UI/API | AWS API Gateway + Lambda |
| `api.flashcards-open-source-app.com` | Backend API | AWS API Gateway + Lambda |

## Client Entry Points

- Hosted web app for humans starts at `https://app.flashcards-open-source-app.com`
- Terminal / AI-agent onboarding starts at `GET https://api.flashcards-open-source-app.com/v1/agent`
- Start here for instructions: `src/content/docs/getting-started.md`, `src/content/docs/api.md`, and `src/content/blog/claude-code-codex-openclaw-flashcards-login.md`

## Content

Typed content modules power composed/list pages:
- `src/content/pages/home.ts`
- `src/content/pages/features.ts`
- `src/content/pages/pricing.ts`

Mostly text pages stay Markdown-backed:
- `src/content/pages/privacy/index.md`
- `src/content/pages/terms/index.md`
- `src/content/docs/*.md`
- `src/content/blog/*.md`

Keep typed content models mirrored with the other marketing website repository. Build-time generation must produce both HTML and Markdown from the same source of truth.
